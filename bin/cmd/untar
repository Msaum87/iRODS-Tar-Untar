#This is to allow iRODS to untar very large tarball files.
#Currently iRODS does not unpack tarballs over ~10GB (varies).
#It will be called via the untar rule, and triggered to run 
#on the resource object server where the tarball has been moved to.
#Best practice: make sure this exists on all servers.
#In the rule: msiExecCmd("untar", "tarPath tarDir", "resourceServer", "", *returnCode);
